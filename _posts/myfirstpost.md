Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Max Bolger and I am a junior standing undergrad at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota. I am majoring in Computational Data Science with minors in Business Analytics and Economics. This website will be my data science portfolio where I document my work and write about it! This website will have four main pages, which are described below:

- The [Main](https://maxbolger.github.io/) section of my site is where you can see some general information and any posts I make, such as this one. 
- The [Portfoilo](https://maxbolger.github.io/portfolio/) section is where my biggest projects are archived.
- The [Resume](https://maxbolger.github.io/resume/) section is where you can find my resume.
- The [About](https://maxbolger.github.io/about/) section is where you can get to know a little more about me.

Stay tuned for more projects and posts, I'm excited to see this website grow!
