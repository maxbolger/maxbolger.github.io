We are on the doorstep of 2021. While it's just yet another New Year event approaching, many of us wait for it more than ever. Probably we are waiting more for the end of 2020 than the beginning of 2021 with the hope that üíâ will change everything.

2020 was a challenging and difficult year for the whole world. However as Albert said:
> In the midst of every crisis, lies great opportunity. - Albert Einstein

Even if 2020 was personally quite productive - it didn't feel like it. Last days I felt like something else should be accomplished before the end of the year. And here I am proud to announce that I am starting my new blog. üöÄ

What readers could expect to find here? Well, it will be like my personal notebook for taking notes of what I am learning. The good news is that I am learning constantly and a lot. The topics that were most interesting to me during the last year were iOS development and machine learning.

While I am professionally working as an iOS developer for quite some time, machine learning was something new for me. Everything started after finishing the [Stanford Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). I realized that this is something I want to get deeper into and apply practically in order to make applications intelligent. So this is what this blog is going to be about - making iOS applications intelligent by applying endless possibilities of machine learning.

Hopefully, readers of this blog will find useful information that inspires make great apps. Maybe even apps that prepare us to fight evil like the worldwide pandemic we are currently witnessing. I want to wish you all a great, super productive, and healthy New Year. Stay positive no matter what challenges you have to fight. ‚úåÔ∏è
