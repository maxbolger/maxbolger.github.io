My first [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) web app is an NFL receiver dashboard that runs analyses on any wide receiver or tight end that has logged at least 30 targets in the 2020 NFL season. Player info, a game log, and six visualizations are all generated solely using [nflfastR](https://www.nflfastr.com/) data

This is the case study for my application to the HUMAC data scientist role. We were given customer order and survey data from a Walmart+ pilot program and were to report anything we could find. I ran some EDA and created a multinomial logistic regression that classified a customers survey response given their order behavior.
