I am a software engineer specializing in iOS apps development.<br>
Since the amazing 2020 💣, I started exploring Machine Learning and I find it super interesting. The content of this blog combines both iOS & ML.<br>
During my spare time, I relax by competitive mountain, XC biking 🚵‍♂️ or doing other sports 🏂.
