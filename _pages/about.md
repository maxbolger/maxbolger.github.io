I am a junior standing undergrad at Hamline University pursuing a major in Computational Data Science with minors in Business Analytics and Economics.<br>
Proficient with python and its data science libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn, sci-kit learn, streamlit, and more.<br>
In my free time, I love to bet on sports, play kendama, and solve rubik's cubes.
